This is the link to my main database, which is a compilation of 10 NFL Draft Classes^[The NFL draft is an event that occurs every year after the football season ends to decide which team college (or in rare cases, international) players ready to turn professional will play for. Each team takes approximately 8 turns to pick players, in ascending order of team wins from the previous season (worst team goes first in each round), although teams are free to trade their draft picks to other teams for veteran players and/or other draft picks. The "draft class" is the group of drafted players in a given year, usually logged with the team and order in the selection process they were drafted.] from 2011-2020, sourced from Sports Reference's football website: Pro Football Reference.^[“2011-2020 NFL Draft Listing.” Sports Reference. Accessed November 3, 2024. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/draft.htm. ]  Pro Football Reference does not have a feature to download draft classes across years, so I copied and pasted each draft table into an excel spreadsheet (.xlsx), adding a `year` variable to distinguish which draft each observation was from and left the other observations unchanged. There are 29 variables and 2544 observations among the 10 draft classes in this file.

## Building the Draft Class: Setting up the `draft` database
### Adding Complexity to Dataset
After submitting progress memo #1, my greatest concern was not having enough "meat on the bone", per sé, to perform a complex enough EDA. Thus, I found two new datasets to join to my original draft profiles, adding 21 new variables to work with.

The first database was sourced from Kaggle,^[Lichtenstein, Jack. “ESPN NFL Draft Prospect Data.” Kaggle, May 5, 2021. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacklichtenstein/espn-nfl-draft-prospect-data/data. ] containing ESPN.com draft data for each prospect. I am curious how the media performs relative to NFL professionals, so the ESPN position and overall rankings will be nteresting variables to explore. In addition, this database contains information on player height, weight, and whether the draft pick was traded, which gives further opprotunity to explore new research questions.
The second database is a summary of NFL coaches by team from 2011-2020, sourced from Sports Reference in an excel spreadsheet I compiled just like my original dataset.^[“2020 NFL Coaches.” Pro Football Reference. Accessed November 26, 2024. https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2020/coaches.htm. ] This dataset not only allows for us to see which coaches are most successful at draft picks, how draft pick success relates to turnover (number of coaches per team over the decade), but also contains inofrmation on wins and losses, playoff success, and Super Bowl wins that will be tremendously useful in exploring relationships between draft success and team success.

## Pre-Draft Scouting: A Univariate Analysis of the NFL Draft
### Finding the Base Variable
To lay the foundation of my EDA, I need to answer a simple yet ambiguous question: for the purposes of the project, which variable best approximates player success? The two candidates are `w_av`, which is Football Reference's weighted career value for each player in the dataset across position, and `dr_av`, which uses the same formula, but omits any accumulated career value after leaving the team that drafted them. The pros of each are 

`dr_av`: Theoretically, we want to know how valuable a draft pick was to the team that drafted them. Since a team does not care how a player performs for other teams after the player is no longer on their team, `dr_av` succeeds at ignoring this marginal performance.

`w_av`: Just because draft value is a more direct estimator of expected value to the team that drafted them, it is not necessarily the best. There is great variance to consider regarding how a player leaves a team. In a worst case, we have a Type II error where a player gets cut from the team that drafted them, then "breaks out" on another team that takes them on. However, even in this case, it may be the coaching staff's fault for failing to recognize the talent their personnel staff provided for them, or failure to wait for the learning curve of the player with the 53-man roster constraint in the NFL. Furthermore, there are cases where the player is traded (and the team gets undetected value in the form of trade compensation), or the team is outbid on a second contract, even though they would have liked to retain the player in the absence of free agency.

Thus, I believe `w_av` is a better estimator. Let's see who the Top 10 players are in `w_av` to confirm our hypothesis.

```{r}
top10_w_av <- draft |>
  arrange(desc(w_av)) |>
  select(player, w_av)
  kable(slice_head(top10_w_av, n = 10), caption = "Top 10 players by w_av")
```
For anyone familiar with the NFL, the problem is obvious. Let's add year to the table.

```{r}
top10_w_av <- draft |>
  arrange(desc(w_av)) |>
  select(player, year, w_av)
  kable(slice_head(top10_w_av, n = 10), caption = "Top 10 players by w_av")
```

w_av is a cumulative statistic, so there is a heavy bias to players drafted on the earlier half of the 2010's decade. We could do an average `w_av` by years active to remedy this, but I would argue that would overweigh the converse, as player performance generally regresses with age. Let's compare how expected value changes by draft year.

```{r}
draft |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(
    mean = mean(w_av, na.rm = TRUE),
    median = median(w_av, na.rm = TRUE),
    sd = sd(w_av, na.rm = TRUE),
    IQR = IQR(w_av, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) |> kable(caption = "summary stats by draft class")
```
![Expected value (mean w_av) by draft class](plots/exp_w_av_1120.png){#fig-exp_w_av_1120}

From @fig-exp_w_av_1120, looks like a logarithmic regression to me. Let's normalize our w_av variable by an exponential approximation to minimize the affect of year possible as much as we can.

```{r}
top10_rel_w_av <- draft |> 
  arrange(desc(rel_w_av)) |>
  select(player, year, rel_w_av)
  kable(slice_head(top10_rel_w_av, n = 10), caption = "Top 10 players by log-adjusted w_av")
```
The years appear to be more randomly distributed, so the model seems to fit expected value. We could also divide by mean, but this assumes that expected/average draft class value is the same across every year, which is not necessarily true (there is variance in the strength of each draft class). In conclusion, therefore, `rel_w_av` will be considered our main variable to estimate success of a draft pick in this exploration.

### Cleaning/Adding Helpful Variables
Reassigned `team` levels ("OAK", "STL", and "SDG") to match with the ("LVR", "LAR", and "LAC") levels to ignore team location. The Oakland Raiders, St.Louis Rams, and San Diego Chargers became the Oakland Raiders, St.Louis Rams, and San Diego Chargers in the 2010's decade, but relocation does not affect team rosters or expected team performance. Thus, location should have no effect on analyzing the `team` variable, unless we are investigating geography. 

Added integer `career_length` and boolean `active` variables to easily recall how long a player played (or has played) in the NFL and whether they are still playing.

Created `pos_group` variable to condense positions into the groups that the NFL talent evaluation community typically uses to bucket players. This makes digesting factor variables much easier, as this cuts our levels from 22 to 10.

### Analysis of rel_w_av
Viewing the density plot of `rel_w_av` (see @fig-dist_value) and the boxplot of `rel_w_av` by `round` (see @fig-dist_value_rnd), the data behaves as we expect. Only 50.7% of players are "starters" for at least one NFL season, and only 22.9% are "starters: for at least 4 years (the duration of an NFL contract). Thus, it makes sense that the density of `rel_w_av` skews heavily to the right, since the near median draft pick does not even start for any season in the NFL. The long tail also makes sense since star players (Russell Wilson, Aaron Donald, Patrick Mahomes), return substantially more value to their teams over their careers than the average player. Grouping `rel_w_av` by round in @fig-dist_value_rnd, the pattern also follows exactly what would be expected: each quartile and the median always decreases as round increases. The soundness of `rel_w_av` in conforming to expected patterns supports the notion that `rel_w_av` is a fairly accurate estimator of success of a draft pick.

![Distribution of player value by round](plots/dist_value_rnd.png){#fig-dist_value_rnd}



### Analysis of pos_group

An important factor variable to consider in the exploration is position group (`pos_group` in tibble). Although `rel_w_av` attempts to determine how valuable a player is independent of position, each player in football performs a completely different role (unlike, say, baseball) and is evaluated on completely different criteria. 

![Density of position targeted by round](plots/pos_group_tile.png){#fig-pg-tile}

@fig-pg-tile confirms that `pos_group` behaves as we would expect. Teams draft what NFL analysts consider "premium" positions (QB, WR, EDGE, OL) more frequently in the early rounds and less valuable positions (ST, RB, LB, TE) more frequently in the later rounds.

![Density of player value by position group](plots/pos_group_density.png){#fig-pg-density}

From @fig-pg-density, we can clearly see the distribution of expected value by `pos_group` is not uniform. Tight ends and defensive backs have an especially high density near 0, whereas offensive lineman and quarterbacks are less dense in this region, meaning they are less likely to outright fail. 

![Density of player value by round, grouped by position](plots/pos_group_value.png){#fig-pg-value}

Furthermore, @fig-pg-value demonstrates that dropoffs in value by round differ by `pos_group`. For example, there is a sharp dropoff in value after the first two rounds for quarterbacks, whereas offensive linemen and defensive backs follow a steady linear decline in value. 

## The EDA Draft

### Round 1: The Main Event 
**Does drafting well actually matter?** 

The NFL draft is the most prominent way NFL teams acquire players. In theory, it is the cornerstone of any football team, as players are required to sign a four-year contract with the team that drafts them at a predetermined wage set by the NFL’s Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). For first-round picks, which have the highest expected value, teams can even opt into adding a fifth year. Since teams are restricted to a fixed amount of spending on salaries (due to the NFL salary cap), successful draft picks provide an extended window where their portion of the salary pie is much smaller than their market value would dictate. This allows teams to sign more of their veteran players to contract extensions and acquire more players from other teams in free agency, strengthening the roster relative to teams who do not have this flexibility. 

To validate the strength of this advantage, we can ask a simple question: *do teams that draft better players win more?*

![Mapping of Relationship between draft success and team success 1](plots/rd1_1_team_by_value.png){#fig-rd1-1}
According to this comparison, it appears there is at least a weak correlation since R = 0.302. However, two factors suggest the correlation could be stronger:

a) Our independent variable is average player value, independent of where they were drafted. This is problematic because draft order is set in reverse order of team performance from the previous season in order to balance out the competition. Thus, independent of any trades, the teams with the lowest win percentages have the highest expected value draft picks.

b) Three of the biggest positive outliers (New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers, Pittsburgh Steelers), drafted the #1, #4, and #26 best players ever by the value metric we are using for the model (Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers, Ben Roethlisberger) in the 2000s decade. Since these players dominated the 2010s decade, and our research question is if teams that draft better players win more, we can reason that these outliers would fit the model much better if we incorporated draft picks before 2010 that played after into our model.


Let's test factor *a)* to see how the relationship changes when weighting value relative to expectation
![Mapping of Relationship between draft success and team success 2](plots/rd1_2_team_by_rel_value.png){#fig-rd1-2}
With value now relative to the expected value of a team's draft picks, we get a much stronger correlation coefficient of R = 0.724. The outliers in factor *b)* above remain, while the negative outliers (who have been given many high expected value picks because of their low win percentage) converge much closer to the line of best fit. While correlation is not extremely strong, there is a clear positive relationship between teams that draft well and teams that perform well on the field. 

While it appears that drafting well over time is linked with sustaining success, we are yet to evaluate whether success in the draft translates to a near-term expected increase in performance. We can start with a simple exploration of the relationship between the strength of a rookie class and team performance during their rookie year.
![Mapping of Relationship between draft success and team success 3](plots/rd1_3_wins_by_value.png){#fig-rd1-3}
It appears there is some positive relationship between drafting well each year and immediate results. Nonetheless, as we mentioned above, the strongest competitive advantage a good draft pick produces are the four-year window where their hit to the salary cap is significantly below what their on-field value dictates. Thus, to evaluate the transition of success, we can evaluate how the relative performance of a team’s “rookie contract” class (i.e. the sum of current rookie class value and the three rookie classes before it in a given year) correlates to success. 

```{r}
draft_class <- draft |> 
  group_by(year, team) |>
  summarize(
    rel_value = sum(rel_pick_av),
    wins = mean(win),
    post = if_else(sum(post_game) > 0, TRUE, FALSE),
    post_wins = mean(post_win),
    sb = if_else(sum(str_detect(super_bowl, "W") == TRUE) > 0, "W", 
         if_else(sum(str_detect(super_bowl, "L") == TRUE) > 0, "L", "no"))
    ) |> arrange(team) 

class_value <- draft_class$rel_value
rc_cycle_value <- vector(length = length(class_value))
for (i in seq_along(1:(length(class_value)-3))) {
  rc_cycle_value = if_else(
    class_value[[i]] == class_value,
    class_value[[i]] + class_value[[i+1]] + class_value[[i+2]] + class_value[[i+3]],
    rc_cycle_value
  )
}
year <- draft_class$year + 3
team <- draft_class$team
rc_cycle <- tibble(team, year, rc_cycle_value)

draft_cycle <- draft_class |>
  right_join(rc_cycle, join_by(team == team, year == year)) |>
  filter(year <= 2020)
```


```{r}

top_10_rc_class <- draft_cycle |>
  ungroup(year) |>
  relocate(rc_cycle_value, .after = team) |>
  rename(rc_class_value = rc_cycle_value, draft_class_value = rel_value) |>
  arrange(desc(rc_class_value)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-rd1-1
#| tbl-cap: "Top 7 rookie contract classes by rc_class_value from 2014-2020"

kable(top_10_rc_class)
```

The rookie contract classes are calculated from 2014 to 2020, since 2014 is the first year where all four rookie draft classes are from 2011 (the earliest year in our dataset) or later. It is evident that a strong rookie contract class is related to stellar on-field performance. Of the teams (in one season) with the top 10 best rookie contract classes over expectation from 2014-2020, 9 of 10 made the playoffs, and their average win percentage was approximately 72%. 

```{r}
top_10_rc_stats <- top_10_rc_class |>
  summarize(
    mean_rc_class_value = mean(rc_class_value),
    mean_draft_class_value = mean(draft_class_value),
    mean_wins = mean(wins),
    playoff_pct = sum(post)/n()
  ) 
```

```{r}
#| label: tbl-rd1-2
#| tbl-cap: "Summary Statistics, Top 10 rookie contract classes"

kable(top_10_rc_stats)
```

Grouping all rookie *contract* classes by regular season wins, the positive correlation of draft value and wining looks considerably stronger relative to rookie class in figure 8.

    R = cor(wins, rc_cycle_value)
  )
